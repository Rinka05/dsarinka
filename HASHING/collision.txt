collision handling 
of two types
in hashmaps 

more than one key wants to go at same place 
1. closed hashing 
-> store it in form of linked make addresses 
-> continous for different values
->this is also called separate chaining 


2. open addressing 
->hi = h f(a)+f(i);
->f(i) = f(0) =0
-> if that place is not already filled fill it else find an alternate place 
1. linear probing f(i) = i;
2. quadratic probing f(i) = i*if
3. double hashing f(i) = i*h'(a) => h'(a) is another hash function
